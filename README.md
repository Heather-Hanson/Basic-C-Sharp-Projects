#C-Sharp-Projects

This repository includes my basic C# and .Net Framework assignments as well as two projects.

Projects:
- Twenty-One Game
- Car Insurance Application

Twenty-One Game
This project is a .Net console app that allows a user to play the game "Twenty-One" against "the computer". It demonstrates logic for all possible combinations of cards
and allows the user to place bets, winning or losing their bet based on the results. This project demonstrates organized classes that allow for reuseable code.

Car Insurance Application
This project is an MVC web application that allows the user to input their information and submit for a car insurance quote. The application performs mathematical operations based on the values input by the user prior to displaying the quote. This project was created by Database First development using Entity Framework and SQL Server.
